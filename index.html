                </h1>
                <p><b>Yum Yum Whey</b> is a unique whey protein concentrate that we specifically designed for all active
                    women.
                    In addition to the delicious taste, you will definitely appreciate that it is <b>enriched with
                        important vitamins, minerals, fat burners and a digestive enzyme.</b> Moreover, due to its high
                    protein
                    content, it contributes to muscle growth, which can result, for example, in a more toned body.
                </p>
                <div class="order-btn">
                    <a href="index.html#order">

                    </a>
                </div>
                <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;">Yum Yum Whey – a high-quality source of protein with
                    great taste designed for women, which will also help replenish selected vitamins, minerals, and
                    other beneficial substances</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="about">
            <h2>What is Yum Yum Whey?</h2>
            <p><b>Yum Yum Whey</b> is a <b>whey protein concentrate with a low sugar content</b> that boasts a
                <b>delicious taste</b> and a
                unique ingredient profile. It is therefore guaranteed to please every woman who follows a healthy diet.
                The main advantage of this protein powder is its high content of quality proteins, which contribute to
                the growth and maintenance of muscle mass. Moreover, they help maintain normal bone condition. This is
                sure to be appreciated by every woman who would like to take care of a <b>functional musculoskeletal
                    system
                    and shapely figure,</b> so that she can show off her six-pack or a round butt. </p>
            <hr>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">In the same way, this protein powder is also suitable to be a part of your
                diet during weight loss. This
                is because it is enriched with selected fat burners. It also contains the popular CLA and L-carnitine
                tartrate, which participates in the metabolism of fatty acids (fats) and energy production. Another
                advantage can be the high content of fibre in this protein powder. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="discover-container">
            <p>Whey protein powders are generally considered to be well digestible. Despite this, we have decided to
                enrich our Yum Yum Whey with the <b>enzyme bromelain</b>. It ranks among proteolytic enzymes that help
                break
                down proteins into better digestible amino acids. However, the included <b>MCT oil</b> has also a role
                to play.
                The latter belongs to a group of exceptional fats with medium chain length. Unlike conventional oils, it
                is quickly digested, and your body can immediately <b>use it as a source of energy for any kind of
                    activity.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                That said, we also can't forget about the important function that the <b>minerals and vitamins</b>
                contained in this protein powder have. For example, vitamin C contributes to the maintenance of
                <b>optimal
                    immune functions</b> during and after physical activity. It is equally important for collagen
                production,
                the functioning of bones, skin and the nervous system, as well as mental well-being.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, it
                helps protect cells from oxidative stress, reduce fatigue and exhaustion, and increases the absorption
                of iron. This helps <b>support the proper function of immunity</b> and optimal production of both red
                blood
                cells and hemoglobin in the body. Optimal iron intake is also no less significant during heavy
                menstruation, as this can result in greater loss of this mineral. </p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h2>Enriched with Bromelain and MCT Oil</h2>
                <p>Yum Yum Whey also contains the vitamins B6 and B12, which help reduce both fatigue and exhaustion.
                    Vitamin B6 itself is also involved in the regulation of hormonal activity. Last but not least, we
                    must also mention the important role of magnesium. It contributes to the proper functioning of
                    muscles, the nervous system and mental well-being. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h2>Key Nutrients for Vitality</h2>
                <p>Another great advantage of this protein powder is its excellent and quick absorption rate (about 10
                    grams of protein per hour). This makes it an ideal candidate for the preparation of a post-workout
                    recovery drink. That said, you can also add it to smoothies, your favourite porridge, desserts and
                    other meals, which it will enrich with a fair serving of protein. For example, it will easily turn a
                    cheesecake into a balanced dessert to go with your coffee.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    No matter if your goal is to gain muscle mass, lose weight or stay in shape, in all these cases, it
                    is
                    essential that your diet contains enough protein to ensure the functioning of all vital processes.
                    All
                    the above makes Yum Yum Whey an effective choice that will help you meet the recommended daily
                    protein
                    intake and, as a result, get you closer to your goals.

                    First, add the necessary amount of dietary supplement, protein, creatine powder, or pre-workout to
                    the shaker bottle.
                    Then add water, milk, fruit drink, or juice and put the lid on the shaker and make sure it's
                    securely closed.
                    Shake the bottle vigorously until the powder is mixed with the liquid. Thanks to the sieve inside
                    the shaker,
                    the powder is mixed very quickly and just after a few seconds, you can consume your favorite drink.
